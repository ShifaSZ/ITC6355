00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.999
welcome to the introductory video on

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.999
beginning JavaScript and this is part of

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.999
our ongoing web development series now

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.999
in terms of prerequisites if you have no

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.999
previous experience with HTML or CSS you

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.999
should go to my youtube channel page and

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.999
take the beginning tutorials on both

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.999
HTML and CSS because they kind of go

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.999
hand-in-hand with JavaScript now in

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.999
terms of what you'll need any text

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.999
editor will do but I will be using

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.999
notepad in this series but again you can

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.999
use any text editor now HTML CSS and

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.999
JavaScript I like to call those the big

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.999
three they work hand-in-hand to produce

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.999
an interactive website HTML of course

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.999
add structure to our webpages so items

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.999
such as layout sections and paragraph

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.999
that makes up our website and really

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.999
gives it an overall structure we use CSS

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.999
to style our HTML tags and so that adds

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.999
style to our webpages so items such as

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
color borders all those types of things
