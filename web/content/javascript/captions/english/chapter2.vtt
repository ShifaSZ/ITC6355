00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.399
welcome to the second beginning tutorial

2
00:00:02.428 --> 00:00:07.080
on JavaScript now in the last video I 

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.790
said we would be using notepad

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.009
throughout the series but I kind of

5
00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.980
changed my mind because it's a little

6
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.079
bit easier to use notepad plus plus with

7
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.730
JavaScript now if you want to use

8
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.528
notepad that's not a problem you can

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
continue to do that but if you want to

10
00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:24.480
use notepad plus plus it's very easy to

11
00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.549
download and it's a very quick install

12
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.859
in fact if you open up your browser and

13
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.449
go to Google and just type in notepad

14
00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.460
plus plus you'll see it comes up very

15
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.100
quickly here and you can just hit this

16
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.380
download link right here and as I said

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.689
it's a very very quick install now once

18
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.969
you open up notepad plus plus I want you

19
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.530
to go ahead and copy this template right

20
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.120
<here because this is going to be the

21
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.549
default template that we'll use

22
00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:49.468
throughout the series and then I want

23
00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.890
you to go ahead and save as and then

24
00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.989
save it as a HTML document and I just

25
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.909
saved it on my desktop so we'll be

26
00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:59.429
reusing this code over and over again

27
00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.218
this basic template now as I said in the

28
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:05.280
last video our JavaScript code goes
