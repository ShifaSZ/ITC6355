00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.999
welcome to your very first tutorial on

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.999
beginning HTML. HTML is the bedrock of

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.999
the world wide web and if you're going

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.999
to do anything even in other languages

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.999
involving the web it is highly important

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.999
you know HTML so let's take a look at

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.999
some of these bullet points and again

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.999
this is an introductory video in the

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.999
next video we'll actually start doing

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.999
some code now as you can see in that

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.999
first bullet point HTML stands for

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.999
hypertext markup language and you might

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.999
say wow what is that but it's actually

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.999
very easy to use HTML. HTML is a document

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.999
that contains text that's it it's very

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.999
easy to read so it's not like Java which

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.999
kind of reads like hieroglyphics hTML is

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.999
just a document that contains text so

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.999
it's similar to like Microsoft Word or

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.999
even notepad or WordPad so again it's

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.999
very easy to read now once you've

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.999
created your HTML document web browsers

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
can read and display documents that
