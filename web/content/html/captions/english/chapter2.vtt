00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.999
hello and welcome to your first tutorial

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.999
on beginning HTML now if you watch the

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.999
introductory video we talked about what

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.999
you needed and I said that all you need

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.999
is notepad so you should go ahead and

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.998
open up notepad now and that's all you

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.999
really need to follow this series now if

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.999
you have other editors you can go ahead

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.999
and use those as well so in this video

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.999
we're gonna create our very first web

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
page using HTML now web browsers can

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.999
display a lot of different documents

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.999
it's not just HTML they can display SVG

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.998
files XML files so the very first thing

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.999
we have to do is tell the browser what

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.999
type of file this is and we do that by

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.999
using the doctype declaration so this

18
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.999
really isn't a HTML section it's just a

19
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.999
declaration and we're telling the

20
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.999
browser exactly what to open here and so

21
00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:56.999
let's go ahead and type in doctype HTML

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we put an exclamation point there

23
00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.920
we've type in doctype and we type in
