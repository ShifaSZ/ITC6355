00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.999
welcome to the second video on CSS today

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.999
we're going to look at changing the font

3
00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:07.999
color the font type in the font size and

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.999
so let's go ahead and use the source we

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.999
did from the last video and let's open

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999
that up now now you will remember that

7
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.999
we created our first rule and that we

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.999
decided to go ahead and style the h1

9
00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:22.948
HTML element right here and we gave it a

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.999
background color of purple and so let's

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.999
just go ahead and take a look at that

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.999
again and there you can see we have our

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.999
purple background now what I want to do

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.999
is create a new role so let's go ahead

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.999
and do that and so we just do the same

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.999
thing we did with the h1 rule we'll just

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.999
copy and paste that and we're going to

18
00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.999
go ahead and style the P HTML element so

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.999
that's right here this one everything

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.999
within here and everything within here

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.999
now what I want to point out is we said

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.999
H 1 here and that equated to the h1

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.999
header when you put in P here and just P

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we are going to alter everything all of
