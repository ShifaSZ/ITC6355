00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.999
welcome to your very first beginning

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.999
tutorial on CSS and this is part of our

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.999
ongoing web development series now if

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.999
you do not have a solid understanding of

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.999
HTML you should go to my channel page

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.999
and go through the HTML for beginners

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.999
tutorial set that's kind of a

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.999
prerequisite now if you already know

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.999
HTML and you feel you don't need that

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.999
that's fine but if you don't know

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.999
anything about HTML I strongly recommend

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.999
that you go ahead and take that series

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.999
because an understanding of HTML is

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.999
really crucial to using CSS now as a

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.999
note we will also be introducing some

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.999
new HTML elements in this series and the

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.999
reason is they go hand-in-hand together

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.999
so it didn't make sense to discuss those

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.999
in the HTML for beginners because they

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.999
really work hand in hand with CSS in

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.999
terms of what you will need we're just

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.999
gonna use notepad for now just like we

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.999
did in the HTML for beginners series now

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.999
eventually we'll use an editor but for

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.999
now we just need no pen okay so what is

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.999
CSS well here's the dictionary version

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
CSS stands for cascading style sheets it
